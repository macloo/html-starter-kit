# HTML Starter Kit

**index.html** Note that the top nine lines are standard for all HTML files. [See it live.](https://macloo.github.io/html-starter-kit/)

HTML tags: `div`, `p`, `h1`, `h2`, `img`, `a href=`

Comments in HTML look like this: `<!-- put stuff here -->`

**javascript_example.html** Demo of interactive JavaScript. [See it live.](https://macloo.github.io/html-starter-kit/javascript_example.html)

**template.html** This is *index.html* with the content removed. The top nine lines are standard, and only the text between the TITLE tags should be changed. If the CSS file has a different filename, that too would be changed.

**Folder structure:** The inclusion of folders named `css`, `images`, and `js` is standard best practice.

**main.css** All visual styles for both *index.html* and *javascript_example.html* are here. The top seven lines are fairly standard. For explanations of CSS selectors and syntax, see [CSS: Cascading Style Sheets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS). Font stacks (`font-family`) follow a specific pattern, ending in one of three generics (`serif`, `sans-serif`, or `monospace`).

**main.js** All the JavaScript is in this file. Note that the file is attached to *javascript_example.html* by means of a `script` element at the bottom of that file, but above the closing `</body>` and `</html>` tags there.
