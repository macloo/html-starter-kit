# HTML Starter Kit

**index.html** Note that the top nine lines are standard for all HTML files.

HTML tags: `div`, `p`, `h1`, `h2`, `img`, `a href=`

**javascript_example.html** Demo of interactive JavaScript.

**template.html** This is *index.html* with the content removed. The top nine lines are standard, and only the text between the TITLE tags should be changed. If the CSS file has a different filename, that too would be changed.

**Folder structure:** The inclusion of folders named `css`, `images`, and `js` is standard best practice.

**main.css** All visual styles for both *index.html* and *javascript_example.html* are here. The top seven lines are fairly standard. For explanations of CSS selectors and syntax, see [CSS: Cascading Style Sheets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).

**main.js** All the JavaScript is in this file. Note that the file is attached to *javascript_example.html* by means of a `script` element at the bottom of that file, but above the closing `</body>` and `</html>` tags there.
